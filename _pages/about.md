This site is dedicated to the ANON Dataset, a crowd-sourced expressive symbolic dataset consisting of **6,035 improvised tapped sequences** performed by **3,184 participants** with varying levels of musical expertise. 

Each sample contains expressive timing and dynamics information and is annotated with the participantâ€™s self-reported level of musical expertise, 
the genre of the selected pattern, the chosen tempo, the total duration to complete the activity, and a user-rating for their performance and how much they enjoyed the exhibit.
